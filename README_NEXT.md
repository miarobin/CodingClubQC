# A Pair of Complicated Algorithms

Now jump back into your qiskit environment again:
```
conda activate ENV_NAME
source ./ENV_NAME/bin/activate
```
And open the second tutorial in your chosen format. Note if you're using the [IBM server](https://quantum-computing.ibm.com/), you can just upload my jupyter notebook.

Here are two algorithms which you can build & run on the IBM quantum computer:
1. The prime factorisation algorithm.
2. Quantum error correction.
Choose one to start with (order doesn't matter).

## 1. The Prime Factorisation Algorithm.


## 2. Quantum Error Correction.
